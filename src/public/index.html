    <p>Outside the gates of a warehouse in southern China, a middle-aged man surnamed Zhang at first showed no interest in talking to us or answering questions about his business dealings in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). </p>

    <p>His mood changed when we mentioned pangolins, a solitary anteater that resembles an artichoke. “Do you have supply?” he said. “Come to our office, let’s talk about it more.”</p>

    <p>As members of the Global Environmental Reporting Collective, we had gone undercover in Africa, South-, Southeast Asia and China to document the supply chain of the illicit global trade in pangolins. </p>

    <p>Our visit to Zhang was part of a wider project, The Pangolin Reports, the result of which you find here. Over the past nine months, we, 32 journalists from countries across the trading routes, have documented how criminal syndicates are meeting this demand for pangolin scales. </p>

    <p>Their trade has become so sophisticated that it reminded experts in some parts of the supply chain of the drug trade in terms of sophistication and scope. “Roughly 50 tonnes of illegal African pangolin scales have been seized globally in the last four months,” estimated Peter Knights, the CEO of WildAid, an advocacy group. “In shipments that contain both pangolins and ivory, pangolin scales have now surpassed the volume of ivory.”</p>

    <p>The high demand has made the pangolin the most illegally traded mammal in the world, according to an expert group with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). All eight subspecies of the shy animal are critically endangered, scientists say. With the disappearance of pangolins, their habitats lose a balancer of ecosystems, feeding on pests such as ants.  </p>

    <p>Who would want pangolin scales? According to some TCM practitioners, pangolin scales can cure a host of ailments, including inflammation and poor lactation in new mothers, and even impotence and cancer. Although its medicinal properties are unproven, mostly Chinese patients are consuming literally tons of these products. Its meat is also prized as a luxury meal item in parts of Asia. </p>

    <p>Zhang works in the supply department of a TCM producer in Shantou, Guangdong Province. “So far this year, we’ve used several tons of pangolin scales,” Zhang said. “We need at least a few hundred kilograms a month.”</p>

    <p>“We ordered a ton of scales last month, but it hasn’t arrived yet,” he said. He added  that they would sell unprocessed scales  to other pharmaceutical companies.</p>

    </div>

    <p>China’s pangolin population has dropped over 90% from the 1960s to 2004 due to massive poaching for its meat a delicacy and scales for medicinal use. The Chinese pangolin has been “commercially extinct” since 1995, <a href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/prop/060216/E-CoP17-Prop-11.pdf" target="_blank">researchers say</a>.</p>

    <p>“In the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction,” Jonathan Baillie, a leading expert, said <a href="https://www.iucn.org/content/eating-pangolins-extinction" target="_blank">in 2014</a>. “There is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue.” In the preceding decade, more than a million pangolins are believed to have been hunted, the IUCN estimated. </p>

    <p>In 2016, a global agreement led to an international ban on the trade of the endangered animal. But that did not turn things around. Record numbers  of pangolins have been seized this year, according to data collected and provided by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an advocacy organisation. </p>

    <p>In February, a 30-ton seizure in Sabah, Malaysia, was the largest recorded so far. In April, the authorities in Singapore intercepted 12.9 tons of scales, a record seizure that is equivalent of 36,000 pangolins. A few days later, Singapore confiscated an additional 12.7 tons.</p>

    <p>In July, another bust led to the discovery of a 11.9-ton shipment, making 2019 a record year even though it over yet.</p>

    <p>Globally, seizures have already surpassed 2018's figures by a wide margin, according to statistics collected by the EIA. Its researchers estimate that the equivalent of 110,182 pangolins have been stopped by law enforcement around the world this year. That is a 54.5% increase compared to the entirety of last year.</p>

    <p>While higher seizures could  point to greater vigilance amongst enforcement agencies, the overwhelming majority of smuggling likely continues to go undetected, our reporting across two continents suggests. Only a tenth of all illegally trafficked wildlife is actually intercepted, <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/05/pangolins-on-the-brink-as-africa-china-trafficking-persists-unabated" target="_blank">according to a recent Interpol estimate</a>. </p>

    <p class="caption">Seizure of illegally trafficked pangolins around the world from 2000 to March 2019, based on publicly available reports. Reproduced with data collected by EIA.</p>

    <p>Despite the scale of the trade, little is actually known about it, even among prosecutors and law enforcement officials in its key market, China. </p>

    <p>We reviewed more than 400 criminal cases in China related to the illegal trade in pangolins from 2005 to 2019. In only a few of the court cases we reviewed were prosecutors able or willing to retrace the smuggling routes to their origins, like  Indonesia and Nigeria.   </p>

    <p>The numbers of pangolin seizures are rising, not only in China, the primary market, but also in transit hubs such as Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong, according to EIA figures. Even there, the origin of the goods remains unknown for the vast majority of those cases, </p>

    <p>China has introduced a system that allows for the continued consumption of pangolins if bred in captivity for use in TCM. But keeping the animals alive in captivity has proven difficult. Due to the high demand and limited regulatory oversight, many suppliers rely on cheaper, illegal imports.  </p>

    <p>This was why we visited Zhang undercover at his factory in southern China. We wanted to know where his scales came from. </p>

    <p>Zhang, the worker at the TCM company in southern China, insisted that his company was willing to pay a surcharge to source only legal scales, even though they can cost up to twice as much. “Price is not a problem,” he said.</p>
